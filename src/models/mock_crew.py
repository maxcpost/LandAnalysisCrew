## Financial Metrics
- **ROI**: 18-22%
- **IRR**: 15-18%
- **NPV**: $22-28 million
- **Payback Period**: 4-5 years

## Investment Scenario Analysis
### Best Case
- Housing demand exceeds projections by 20%
- Construction costs come in under budget
- Faster absorption rate
- ROI: 25-30%

### Most Likely Case  
- Housing demand meets projections
- Construction costs on budget
- Standard absorption rate
- ROI: 18-22%

### Worst Case
- Housing demand 15% below projections
- Construction costs 10% over budget
- Slower absorption rate
- ROI: 12-15%

## Comparative Market Analysis
This property compares favorably to similar development opportunities in the region:
- Price per acre: 10% below market average
- Development costs: In line with regional averages
- Projected sales prices: 5% above regional averages
- Timeline to completion: Standard for this market

## Investment Strategy Recommendations
1. **Development Type**: Mid-density residential with open space preservation
2. **Phasing**: 3 phases over 4-5 years
   - Phase 1: Infrastructure and 80 units
   - Phase 2: 100 units
   - Phase 3: 70-120 units
3. **Timing**: Begin pre-development immediately, break ground in 8-12 months

## Risk Factors and Mitigation
1. **Zoning Approval Delays**
   - Mitigation: Early engagement with planning department
   
2. **Infrastructure Costs**
   - Mitigation: Partner with local utility providers

3. **Market Fluctuations**
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with decision points
