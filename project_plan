# Property Analysis AI Agent Program Directions

## Project Overview

This document provides comprehensive direction for an AI agent program designed to analyze potential properties for a high-density, master-planned community development project. The program will leverage CrewAI with Llama 3.3 70B to analyze property data from a CSV file and gather supplementary information from web searches to produce detailed property analysis reports.

### Background Context

Our company is developing master-planned communities featuring:
- 80% high-quality manufactured homes
- 15% apartment/condo homes
- 5% traditional/"stick" built homes

These communities will include various amenities (pools, gyms, pickleball courts), subscription services (housekeeping, landscaping, daycare, fitness training), and advanced technology integration to enhance resident satisfaction and quality of life.

## Technical Specifications

### Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Mac computer
- **Model**: Llama 3.3 70B (locally served)
- **Framework**: CrewAI for agent orchestration
- **Data Source**: CSV file containing property listings and associated data
- **Setup**: Automated setup.sh script for environment configuration and model deployment

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Interaction
- The program should prompt the user to select a property for analysis by entering the "Stock#" from the CSV file
- Provide a clear interface for initiating analysis and displaying results

### 2. Data Processing
- Load and parse the provided CSV file containing property listings
- Extract all relevant data for the selected property (identified by Stock#)
- Handle different data types appropriately (numerical, categorical, geographical)
- Process demographic data at multiple radius points (3-mile, 5-mile, 10-mile)
- Calculate growth trends and comparative metrics across time periods (2020-2024-2029)
- Normalize data where appropriate for meaningful comparisons
- Integrate market analysis scores and rankings into the assessment

### 3. Agent Crew Structure

   - Housing shortage statistics and impacts
   - Recent development projects and reception
   - Manufactured housing regulations and acceptance

3. **Infrastructure and Services**

  - Construct targeted searches rather than broad queries
  - Use multiple search variations to ensure comprehensive results

- **Source Evaluation**:
  - Prioritize local news sources, government sites, and reputable real estate resources
  - Assess source credibility before including information

  - Summarize findings in standardized format
  - Maintain proper attribution with URLs and publication dates
  - Assign confidence ratings to information (High, Medium, Low)

- **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Respect website terms of service and robots.txt directives
  - Implement appropriate rate limiting to avoid overloading sites
  - Do not attempt to bypass paywalls or access restricted content
  - Store only essential information needed for analysis
